    "This notebook is the continuation of the implementation of CRISP-DM methodology on the AL, ML, Data salaries dataset from Kaggle. com.\n",

    "## 1.1 Continuing the Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extract many valuable insights from this dataset. As this datset provides three years salary data (dependent variable) of three major fields (AI, ML, and Data), we can address some of the following questions from the thorough analysis of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hierarchical Clustering and RFECV\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can we group similar types of jobs based on their salaries and other features using clustering techniques?\n",
    "[ANSWER TO PROBLEM STATEMENT 1](#ANSWER-TO-PROBLEM-STATEMENT-1)\n",
    "* What are the most important features in predicting salaries in the AI, ML, and Data fields?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can we predict salaries in the AI, ML, and Data fields based on certain features such as job title, experience level, or company size?\n",
    "* What is the best model or technique for predicting salaries in the AI, ML, and Data fields based on our evaluation criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Relevant Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem statement and the use of the CRISP-DM philosophy, the success criteria for the project can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Cluster Analysis:__ Successfully group similar types of jobs based on their salaries and other features using clustering techniques. The success criterion could be creating meaningful clusters that accurately represent different job groups based on salary levels and other relevant characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Identification of Key Factors:__ Identify the most important features that contribute to salary prediction in the AI, ML, and Data fields. This can be determined by analyzing the feature importance or coefficients of the predictive model. The success criterion could be identifying the top three factors that have the highest impact on salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Accuracy of Salary Prediction:__ Develop a predictive model that accurately predicts salaries in the AI, ML, and Data fields based on relevant features such as job title, experience level, and company size. The success criterion could be achieving a certain level of accuracy, such as an overall prediction accuracy of 80% or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meeting these success criteria would indicate a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, providing valuable insights into salary trends, predictive modeling, and the factors influencing salaries in the AI, ML, and Data fields."

    "## 2.2 Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "## ANSWER TO PROBLEM STATEMENT 1\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer one of our prolem statement that:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Can we group similar types of jobs based on their salaries and other features using clustering techniques?__\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now try to group 12 different job titles in the `general_job_title` feature into similar categories using the heirarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters based on their similarity or dissimilarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our dataset, we can apply hierarchical clustering to group similar job titles based on the similarity or dissimilarity of the other features in our dataset, such as `work_year`, `company_location`, `experience_level`, `remote_ratio`, and `employee_residence` etc. By applying hierarchical clustering, we can obtain a dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram that displays the hierarchical relationship between the clusters. The dendrogram can help us visualize the similarities and dissimilarities between the job titles and identify potential groups or clusters that may exist within the data.\n",
    "However, in order to do this, we need to transform the categorical features into numerical features to make the model simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The key take away from this is that we do not always have to include all the variables in our analysis. Sometimes, simpler analysis is better\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The two main ingredients of hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several distance metrics available for calculating the distances between data points in hierarchical clustering. Some of the commonly used distance metrics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Euclidean distance: This is the most commonly used distance metric in clustering algorithms. It measures the straight-line distance between two points in a multidimensional space.\n",
    "* Manhattan distance: This metric is also known as the city block distance or taxicab distance. It measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates.\n",
    "* Gower distance: This is a similarity measure used for calculating the distance between two samples with mixed data types, such as numerical, categorical, or ordinal data. It is a modified form of the Manhattan distance that is scaled by the range of each feature\n",
    "* Chebyshev distance: This metric measures the maximum distance between two points in any dimension. It is also known as the chessboard distance.\n",
    "* Cosine distance: This metric measures the angular distance between two vectors. It is commonly used in text data analysis and recommendation systems.\n",
    "* Jaccard distance: This metric is used to measure the similarity between two sets of binary data. It is commonly used in clustering categorical data.\n",
    "* Hamming distance: This metric is used to measure the similarity between two binary strings of equal length. It counts the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.\n",
    "* Mahalanobis distance: This metric takes into account the correlation between variables in the dataset. It is used when the dataset has a covariance structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the commonly used distance metrics in clustering algorithms. The choice of distance metric depends on the nature of the data and the clustering problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different linkage methods in hierarchical clustering. Some of the most commonly used linkage methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single Linkage: In this method, the distance between two clusters is defined as the minimum distance between any two points in the two clusters. This method tends to produce long, thin clusters and is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "* Complete Linkage: In this method, the distance between two clusters is defined as the maximum distance between any two points in the two clusters. This method tends to produce compact, spherical clusters and is less sensitive to outliers than single linkage.\n",
    "* Average Linkage: In this method, the distance between two clusters is defined as the average distance between all pairs of points in the two clusters. This method strikes a balance between single linkage and complete linkage and is less sensitive to outliers than single linkage.\n",
    "* Ward's Method: In this method, the distance between two clusters is defined as the increase in the sum of squared distances when the two clusters are merged. This method tends to produce clusters of similar size and is less sensitive to outliers than single linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other less commonly used linkage methods include centroid linkage, median linkage, and weighted linkage."
